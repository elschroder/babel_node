    <h2><em>Puentes</em> Project</h2>
    <h3>Room for the integration of immigrants and their families.</h3>
    <div>
      The <em>Puentes</em> project wants to have a direct impact on the quality of life for newcomers to our society, who are in a position of vulnerability or risk of social exclusion, using multiculturalism as project basis.
    </div>
    <div>
      The origin of the idea of the <em>Puentes</em> Project emerges with the increase in immigration in recent times. For a newcomer, migration can become an opportunity for growth if you have the opportunity to use psychological and social resources to cope.

    <h3>Project on Systemic Social Coaching</h3>
    <div>
      The project will take action on situations or circumstances that may interfere with the establishment of satisfactory relationships and the achievement of well-being in relation to different areas of their lives, and from the willingness and commitment of these people. The project aims to implement an innovative methodology in the design of social work to be effective in the current social circumstances.
    </div>
    <div>
      This project, in this period of crisis and rupture of models, is necessary to help manage the discomfort of people through an innovative methodology for the ability to socialize and individualize responsibility. The current model of society often promotes the opposite: see the capacity as an individual skill, which is not shared. This project, based on systemic coaching tools, wants to work to make what is socially stimulating and integrating is common to everyone.
    </div>
    <div>
      The project is based on appreciative inquiry, in what we do well, to extract individual values ​​(set of attitudes, interests and orientations) that lead to a fulfilling life.
    </div>
    <div>
      The project has a network of coaches specialized in Systemic Coaching.

    <h2>Interversia Cycles</h2>
    <div>
      Babel Punto de Encuentro Foundation's Interversia Cycles are designed to improve the understanding of the environment and of ourselves in the context of migration processes through quality knowledge.
    </div>
    <div>
      Interversia are cycles of free talks aimed at people interested and involved in immigration whose main goal is to improve both the environment and knowledge of oneself and learn to use it as a nexus of interaction.
    </div>
    <div>
      Some of the topics covered in the lectures of Interversia are: recognize our perception of the society in which we live; learn to change the image that society has of ourselves; learn how to live in the city, by creating our own identity, through learning to participate in what the city has to offer and how to interact with it, or how to face the world of work, with its elements of discrimination and chances.
    </div>
    <div>
      The talks, which we like to call "Formative Dialogues", are the responsibility of the leading experts in their professional fields of study. Our goal is to create informal circles of interaction in which the basis of intercultural communication - understood as an exchange of knowledge - is to be done horizontally.
    </div>
    <div>
      At the end of the cycle, participants receive a diploma by the Fundación Babel Punto de Encuentro certifying their attendance.
