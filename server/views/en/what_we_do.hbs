  <span class="s1">Our philosophy in development cooperation:</span>
</h3>
<p class="p2">
  From&nbsp;BPDE&nbsp;Foundation&nbsp;we understand that&nbsp;the actions taken by&nbsp;public and private actors, between&nbsp;countries&nbsp;of&nbsp;different&nbsp;income levels,&nbsp;have the&nbsp;purpose of promoting economic and social&nbsp;progress&nbsp;in the South countries, so&nbsp;it is&nbsp;more balanced&nbsp;and sustainable.in relation to the northern countries.
</p>
<p class="p2">
  Our Foundation&nbsp;sees development&nbsp;as self-development, people is not developed by others ; they,and their cultures and&nbsp;nations, develop&nbsp;themselves.&nbsp;Others&nbsp;can help,&nbsp;encourage, assist,&nbsp;facilitate, but&nbsp;also prevent,&nbsp;hinder,&nbsp;etc..
</p>
<p class="p1">
  We agree&nbsp;on a&nbsp;multidimensional&nbsp;concept&nbsp;of development,&nbsp;whom we can&nbsp;express&nbsp;five major&nbsp;dimensions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li class="p1">
    <span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>Peace, the foundation&nbsp;and&nbsp;prerequisite&nbsp;of development.
  </li>
  <li class="p1">
    <span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>The economy,&nbsp;its growth understood as&nbsp;engine of progress.
  </li>
  <li class="p1">
    <span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>The environment&nbsp;and the protection&nbsp;of sustainable&nbsp;ecology.
  </li>
  <li class="p1">
    <span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>Justice,&nbsp;as foundation of social life.
  </li>
  <li class="p1">
    <span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>Participation&nbsp;and democracy, understood as&nbsp;requirements and&nbsp;basis&nbsp;of good governance.
  </li>
  <li class="p1">
    <span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>Values,&nbsp;​​as the basis&nbsp;of&nbsp;all our actions and&nbsp;relationships.

  We work in <strong>Senegal</strong>, specifically in the neighborhood of <strong>Sam Sam</strong>, located in the district of Diamaguène-SICAP Mbao <strong>Pikine</strong> city, which belongs to the region of <strong>Dakar</strong>. The permanent poverty, economic insecurity and the need to survive day to day, is the only concern of its inhabitants. The lack of education of children and youth, and high unemployment, are one of the reasons why BPDE has chosen to work there.
